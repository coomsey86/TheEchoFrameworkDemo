# Echo Framework™ – Demo Web App Plan (Phase 1)
Author: Paul McCombs (Coomsy)  
Protected under Echo Framework Failsafe 263826

## Purpose
This app is a functional teaser/demo of the Echo Framework’s core architecture:
- Encrypted comms logic
- Vault state transitions
- AI-ready UI container

## Features Included
| ID       | Title               | Description                                |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| messaging | Real-time Messaging | End-to-end secure comms system             |
| vault     | Secure Vault        | Toggle: Locked → Syncing → Unlocked       |
| ai        | AI Assistant        | Pattern-linked voice/logic integration     |

## Vault Toggle Logic
- Vault defaults to `locked`
- Click toggles to `syncing`, then `unlocked`
- Reset = click again → `locked`

This logic mimics emotional security layering from Echo Framework vault design.

## Phase 2 Plan
- Add voice command logic for AI Assistant
- Integrate encrypted file preview
- Support server sync + sandboxed preview
- Allow theme shifting (dark/light + pattern themes)
